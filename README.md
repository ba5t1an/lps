# lps
lps is a web platform to automatically create shift schedules. The creating of the schedules is based on linear programming methods and uses Google's OR-Tools to solve the respective models. The project is currently postponed but will be continued in the future. Hence, it's currently only uploaded as showcase for Java related programming skills.
